# SoftSensConf

This is a software tool for configuring an advanced measurement instrument through the use of serial communication from a Windows application, as well as saving logged data to a SQL database. The software should be able to handle more than one DAU which has one or more than one sensor/instrument connected. As a user of the program you will only be able to configure and logg data from one device at a time. Keep in mind that this software was made as part of the exame in the "object-oriented programming and databases" class @USN (University of South-Eastern Norway). Errors may occur, but I will try to fix and update what is needed when I have some free time.

PS! The executable file is located in "bin" --> "Debug".
